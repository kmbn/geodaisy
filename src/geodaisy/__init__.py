"""
Geodaisy is a Python library for creating geo objects represented by types
and coordinates and translating between various standards and
representations, including GeoJSON, Well Known Text, and Python's
__geo_interface__ protcol, which is used by other geo libraries.

Geodaisy is lightweight and does not rely on C/C++ dependencies like libgeos.

Usage example:
   >>> from geodaisy.geo_object import GeoObject
   >>> geo_obj = GeoObject(thing)
   >>> geo_obj.geojson
   {'coordinates': XXX, 'type': xxx}

For more information about the library and how to use it, see README.md.
